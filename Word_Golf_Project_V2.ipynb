    "## 27 Hour Coding Challenge:  Word Golf!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a challenging problem that will require not only all of your current coding skills but will also force you to think of new ways to accomplish things you've never done before.  LEVEL 1 will test your coding chops and perhaps even give you a false sense of confidence. The LEVELS that follow will test your mettle, your grit, your ability to endure against odds and against seemingly insurmountable challenges.  You have 27 hours to accomplish as many of the challenges listed below as you can complete.  LEVEL 1 should be doable using only the two class periods allotted to this Challenge -- climbing beyond LEVEL 1, however, will require additional grit, determination, struggle and a little moxie.  Do you have what it takes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most things worth doing, this won't be easy.  Like most things worth doing, you will receive no grade for the task.  There is no prize but honor, no fee but struggle, but the glory of accomplishment is real!\n",
    "\n",
    "### On to the Game:\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been contracted by a major game development company to build a gaming engine for their blockbuster game, **Word Golf**(tm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the rules of **Word Golf**.  You are given two words of equal length, and you must find a path between those two words by only changing a single letter at a time to create a path of real words from the first word to the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:  If you are given these two words: **CARS** and **DRAT**, you might find a path like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    CARS -> CART -> DART -> DAFT -> DEFT -> DEBT -> DEET -> BEET -> BEAT -> BRAT -> DRAT\n",
    "\n",
    "This would be a score of 10 because there are 10 steps between these two words on this path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to create the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### LEVEL 1 (base camp and the start of the climb)\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.1: Write a function that takes in 2 words of equal length and determines if they are only one Word Golf move away from each other.  For example:  CART and CARS would return True, but CARS and BARN would return False.  CART only needs to change one letter T->S to get to CARS, but CARS would need to change C->B and S->N to get to BARN, so they are not \"one away.\"\n",
    "    1.2: Write a program or function that takes in two words and a list of words and determines if the list is a  valid solution to get from word 1 to word 2.  If it is NOT a valid solution, it returns False.  If it is a valid solution, it returns the SCORE.  For example:\n",
    "    valid_score('cats','yarn',['cats','cars','bars','barn','yarn']) would return 4 because it is valid and takes four steps to get from CATS to YARN\n",
    "    valid_score('cats','yarn',['cats','bars','barn','yarn']) would return FALSE because you can't get from CATS to BARS in one step.\n",
    "    * note for 1.2, you do NOT need to validate if each of the words are actually English words\n",
